# Contributing guide

## Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Code style

Start by making sure that your code is readable, consistent, and pretty.

## Send a pull request

- Your proposed changes should be first described and discussed in an issue.
- Open the branch in a personal fork, not in the team repository.
- Every pull request should be small and represent a single change. If the problem is complicated, split it in multiple issues and pull requests.
